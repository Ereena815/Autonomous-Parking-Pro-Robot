# Autonomous-Parking-Pro-Robot
The Parking Pro robot is an autonomous parking system designed to navigate and park in a parking lot or similar environment. The robot is built using the Pololu Zumo Robot platform, equipped with various sensors and programmed to perform different parking maneuvers.

The robot incorporates three key components: ultrasonic sensors, reflectance sensors, and motor control. The ultrasonic sensors are used to detect obstacles and determine the availability of parking spaces. They provide information about the distance between the robot and objects in its surroundings. The reflectance sensors, on the other hand, are used for line detection. They can identify lines or markings on the ground, which are crucial for accurate parking maneuvers.

The robot operates based on a set of predefined parking maneuvers: forward parking, reverse parking, and parallel parking. These maneuvers are executed based on the information gathered from the sensors. When the robot detects an empty parking space, it uses motor control to perform the appropriate parking maneuver.

The motor control system allows the robot to move forward, backward, and turn. It controls the speed and direction of the robot's movements, enabling precise navigation and parking. The robot's movements are coordinated based on the sensor inputs and the desired parking maneuver.

To implement the autonomous parking system, the robot is programmed using the Arduino IDE and the C++ programming language. It utilizes the ZumoRobot library for basic motor and sensor control on the Zumo Robot platform. Additionally, the NewPing library is used for interfacing with the ultrasonic sensors, and the PID library assists with fine-tuning the motor control for accurate parking maneuvers.

Overall, the Parking Pro robot provides a practical solution to real-world parking challenges. It can autonomously navigate parking lots, detect obstacles, and perform different parking maneuvers, making it a valuable tool for optimizing parking efficiency and reducing the complexity of parking in crowded environments.
